# Welcome!
Thank you for joining us in our mission to feed low income children and their families! If you haven't done so already, you can find some info about us at our [website](https://nourimeals.com/).

We have a secondary mission which is to help mentor and build up software engineer leaders.

## Important Notes
- If you get stuck or need permissions for things, reach out to our other devs in Slack or Amber Kim who is our Tech Lead.
- If you find ways to improve our documentations, take ownership and create Pull Requests or Issues

## Board Members
- President & Tech Lead: Amber Kim
  - Office Hours: Saturday mornings from after standup to 11am PST.

## Repositories
We have public repos in our GitHub org but also private repos in Amber's account for now. We plan to migrate the private repos to the org once we have more substantial code and funding. Once we've validated and cleaned things up for the public, we plan on making the private repos or creating a public version of the private repos to release for open source.

## When life happens or your priorities change
Let us know! Most of us have day jobs and other commitments. How much you commit is exactly up to you. If you're no longer able to volunteer, we will just remove you from private channels and from certain repos and tools since we are limited in capacity in some tools and because we will be working with certain private information.
