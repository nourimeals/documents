## When life happens or your priorities change
Let us know! Most of us have day jobs and other commitments. How much you commit is exactly up to you. If you're no longer able to volunteer, we will just remove you from private channels and from certain repos and tools since we are limited in capacity in some tools and because we will be working with certain private information.
