# Working with GitHub Issues
Each repository on GitHub has an ``Issues`` tab. Figure out what repository/repositories you want to work on and check out the issues.

If you need more details, ask. Being able to and practicing how to ask good questions is part of our growth especially as developers. Check out [How to ask questions](./how_to_ask_questions.md).

Find an issue you want to work on that is not assigned to anyone or has not been worked on for two weeks and assign it to yourself. If you can, message the person who had the task assignment before you so you can get more info or see if they are still planning on working on it.

No issues? Ask and we can find something for you to work on. Once you have a task and there is no issue for it, create an issue.

# Deadlines
We know that life happens.
- The default deadline for a small task is 2 weeks from your last communication inside the GitHub Issue. If you have not made any progress or left an update in the issue thread, then your issue can be assigned to or taken over by someone else. If you return after two weeks and find that your issue has been taken over, then feel free to find a new issue you can tackle.
- If you do know that you are no longer able to take on the task, then remove yourself from the issue so someone else can take it on.
- If you need more time, just let us know.
- Custom deadlines. Some tasks may need to be assigned a custom deadline by the team. You can also feel free to give yourself a custom deadline if there is no assigned deadline. Put your deadline in a comment in the issue.
- Use these deadlines to help you with learning how to estimate and plan stories in conjunction with your capacity as you would in the workplace.
