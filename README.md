# Nouri Documents

This repository holds all of Nouri's public, global documents.

One of Nouri's mission is to enable people in our communities to have good careers to enable them to support themselves and their families.

One of the ways we do this is through mentoring and helping our volunteers gain real world experience through our software projects. Many of the resources in this repository are here to support that mission.
