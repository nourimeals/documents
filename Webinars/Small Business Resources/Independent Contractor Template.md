Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall be considered an offer until accepted by Client and shall be withdrawn if not executed by Client within 14 days of Client's receipt. In the event that the offer in this Agreement is withdrawn but the parties wish the enter into the Agreement, Contractor will provide to Client a new Agreement.

Written notice under this Agreement may be provided by mail, email, or social media messaging if the parties have established communication under such method.

(c)   The parties represent that they are fully authorized and empowered to enter into this Agreement, and that the performance of the obligations under this Agreement will not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third-party, or violate any agreement between the parties and any other person, firm or organization or any law or governmental regulation.

3. 	Independent Contractor Status

(a)  The parties intend that the Contractor and any Contractor Personnel be engaged as independent contractors of Client.

If the Work Product or any portion of the Work Product does not qualify as work made for hire, and/or as otherwise necessary to ensure the Client's complete ownership of all rights, titles and interest in the Work Product, the Contractor shall transfer and assign to the Client all rights, titles and interests throughout the world in and to any and all Work Product. This transfer and assignment includes, but is not limited to, the right to publish, distribute, make derivative works of, edit, alter or otherwise use the Work Product in any way the Client sees fit.

6. 	Liability; No Warranties

(a)  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BODILY INJURY, DEATH, LOSS OF REVENUE, OR PROFITS OR OTHER BENEFITS, AND CLAIMS BY ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THE PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING WITHOOT LIMITATION TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHER TORTS.

(b)   THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY THE PARTIES HEREUNDER.
