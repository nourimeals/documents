# How Nouri Feeds People.

## The Stakeholders

1. Families: the families who need our help, and who we feed. Typically families who are with school aged children who are not getting enough help to feed their children good nutrition.
2. Chapter Leaders: coordinators between the community (other non profits), families, business (farms).
3. Delivery Team: Get the food, deliver the food.
4. Farms: Provide the food.


## How Seattle-Eastside gets the food from Farm to Family

This is our current process that we would like to replace with automation so that we can spend more time doing other things and solving other problems for families.

1. Families sign up through Google Forms. Their information is then saved into a Google Sheet.
2. Every other week, we ask our independent contractor drivers if they will be available on a day we pick for deliveries.
3. Based on the capacity of our drivers, we notify the families and ask them if they will be available for a delivery. They need to respond by a deadline in order to be added to the delivery list. This is important so that only families who are interested and available will get the delivery and we make sure that the food will not be left out long or for other folks to steal. This process is a little bit different for our food pantry parter's clients. The food pantry is responsible for making sure their clients will be available. We automatically assume that their clients will need a delivery.
4. After the list has been finalized, delivery sheets that detail each driver's route is created and food is ordered from a local farm.
5. On delivery day, the Delivery lead or backup delivery person will pay the local farm for the food, the team will sort the food into different boxes for families, pick food from our food pantry partners if possible, and then deliver the food as soon as possible to families to ensure freshness.

NOTES:
- We try to track driver vehicle capacity so that we have an estimate of how much a driver can load and delivery using each of their vehicles.
